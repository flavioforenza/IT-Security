# **Heap overflow on Metadata** 

There are C programs examples that expose a heap overflow vulnerability. In
particular there are two house of force programs and one unsafe\_unlink.c.
house\_of\_force.c has been presented at the lecture 17/10/2019. While house of
force\_exercise is the new one that follow the house of force technique principles.

## Goal
The main goal of these challenges is to modify a pointer to a string or piece of code to prove the ability to write anywhere whatever value we want. 

## Compiling programs
For compiling the program just type the command make.
